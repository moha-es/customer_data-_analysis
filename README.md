## 📈 Analysis & Insights

### 1. 💸 Income vs Spending Score

A scatter plot comparing annual income with spending score.

**Insight:**  
There is no strong correlation between income and spending score.  
Some low-income customers spend more than high-income customers, suggesting that income does not predict spending behavior.
